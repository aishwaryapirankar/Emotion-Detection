# Emotion Detection and Key Facial Points Detection

This project focuses on developing models for key facial points detection and facial expression detection using computer vision techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately detect key facial points and recognize facial expressions from images. The project utilizes datasets from two Kaggle competitions: [Facial Keypoints Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/overview) and [Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).

## Key Highlights

- Developed models for key facial points detection and facial expression detection with classes including anger, disgust, sad, happiness, and surprise.
- Conducted data preparation and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
- Achieved an accuracy of 83.9% for key facial points detection and 88.2% for emotion detection tasks.
- Integrated both models to provide a comprehensive solution for emotion recognition and facial analysis.
